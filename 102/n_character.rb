# Write a function that takes a string s and an integer n, and returns whether or not the string s contains at most n different characters.
#For example, ncset("aacaabbabccc", 4) would return true, because it contains only 3 different characters, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and 3 â‰¤ 4.
# For how many English words (yes, it's time for this dictionary again!) does ncset(word, 4) hold?
